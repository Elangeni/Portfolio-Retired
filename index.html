            <td>Hello! My name is Elangeni, a graduate student based in
              New York, NY. I am currently attending Pace University where I
              study software development and engineering.
              Software development has always been a passion of mine and
              I genuinely enjoy every aspect of the development cycle.

              I discovered my love for this field shortly after graduating with
              my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the University of the
              Virgin Islands. I began to create intuitive mobile and web apps
              with efficient, modern backends. Now that I am beginning my
              second year as a graduate student, I am searching for internship
              opportunities.</td>
